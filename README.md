# Family Tree Web App 

#### Currently making a very simple family web app. Always had wanted to make one, but never had the time till now.

Created using vite/react with react-flow. Not as complicated as I have thought it was to make.

~~~bash
npm i
npm run dev
~~~

- The Family does not store data within a database and is saved locally in your machine. As long as you don't reset your cache, then it's all goods.
